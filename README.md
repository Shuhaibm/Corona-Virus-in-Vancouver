# Corona Virus in Vancouver Website

Whenever I find the need to go outside, I am always very weary of the possibility
of encountering the corona virus. I have not been able to find a website that
shows we where there have been outbreaks, so I decided to make one myself. This
website displays the information provided by Vancouver Costal Health through a
map where the user is able to click on a location on the map and see the reported
outbreaks in the area. They are also able to add outbreaks of their own to the map.


## User Stories
- As a user, I am able to view the associated Links on an area by clicking on it
- As a user, I am able to add an instance of an outbreak to a specific area
- As a user, I want to be able to save the added instances
